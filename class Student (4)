Classes and inheritance
Create a class in Swift named Student
with attributes: student no, name, age, average
and create a constructor.
Then in the main class create an array and fill it from the user by the keyboard. Then

1. print the details of the student who's average greater than 90
2. Find and print the details of the student who has the highest average
3. let the user enter a name and print the student details but if not found print a messages says that

//the student class

import Foundation

class Student{
    var studentNo:Int
    var studentName:String
    var studentAge:Int
    var studentAvg:Double
    
    //creating the init which is the constructor
    init(no:Int, name:String, age:Int, avg:Double){
        self.studentNo = no
        self.studentName = name
        self.studentAge = age
        self.studentAvg = avg
    }
    
    //print the student details
    func printStudent(){
        print("Student No:\(self.studentNo)\t Student Name:\(self.studentName)\t Student Age:\(self.studentAge)\t Student Average:\(self.studentAvg)")
    }
}



\\the main class
import Foundation

//create an array of students
var studentList = [Student]()

//ask the user to tell hoe many students
print("How many students do you have?")
let n = Int(readLine()!)!

    //crate the object
    studentList.append(Student(no: no, name: name, age: age, avg: avg))
}

//print the details of any student their average more than 90
for st in studentList {
    if st.studentAvg > 90 {
        st.printStudent()
    }
}
//create a function that finds and returns the index of student who has the highest average
func highestAvg() ->Int{
    //let max to be the first average of the array

//let the user enter a student name, search if the names found print the student details, otherwise print a message says not found

print ("Enter a student name to print their details:")
var studentName = readLine()!
//create a function that returns the index of the student with the given name or returns -1 if the student not found
